# Crypto Clustering

<br>

For this challenge I utilized my knowledge of Python, Unsupervised Learning, KMeans, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA to look at cryptocurrency market data and create elbow curves and scatter plots that depict the number of clusters. This analysis was based on the performance of various cryptocurrencies over 7 different holding periods. 

This analysis found that the best k value for the data was 4 clusters when using its 3 principal components. The total explained variance of the 3 pricipal components showed 89.5% of the data is represented when compared to the original, which means that 10.5% was left out.
